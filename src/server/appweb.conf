#
#   This configuration files supports all handlers: ESP, EJS, CGI and
#   File handler. Disable handlers you do not require.
#
#   The order of configuration directives matters as this file is parsed only
#   once. This is a minimal configuration. See the max.conf for examples of
#   other configuration directives.

#
#   The install.config specifies: Documents, Listen and ListenSecure

#
#   Error logging configuration. This is for server errors.
#   This is overridden by appweb command line args.
#

#   Define the request tracing log. This is for client requests and responses
#   including HTTP headers. This is overridden by appweb command line args.

#   The user and group account to run as. The fake name APPWEB will change
#   user/group to the Appweb default user/group if running as root/adminstrator.
#   This is www on MAC, nobody/nogroup on Linux, and administrator on Windows.
#   NOTE: ESP requires write access to the cache directory. if you wish
#   to backup log files, you must have write permission to the log file directory.
