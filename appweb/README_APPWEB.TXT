README.TXT for the Appweb Server.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Appweb server directory builds and packages the Appweb product. The 
source in this directory builds the appweb main program.

You can run Appweb by hand or use "make run" to run it. To debug on linux,
type "make debug". To debug on Windows, run Visual Studio and open 
../bin/Debug/appweb.exe.

Appweb can be configured via the command line or it can parse a configuration
file of directives.

To run appweb using a configuration file:

    ../bin/appweb -f appweb.conf

To run appweb via the command line:

    ../bin/appweb -a IP:PORT -d webDirectory

To display trace to the console:

    ../bin/appweb -f appweb.conf -l stdout:2


Windows
-------
On windows, Appweb can run in three modes. It can run as a windows service, 
as a graphical windows application or as a command line application. By
default, it is installed as a windows service. Once Appweb is installed, you
can use the system services applet under Control Panel -> administration tools
to start and stop the Appweb service.
