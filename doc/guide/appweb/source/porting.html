             Porting Appweb</h1>
          </div>

          <div class="guideSection">
            <p>Porting any software is not for the novice, it requires
            considerable skill to read someone else's code and to adapt it to
            a new environment. These instructions are intended for
            experienced and talented developers who want to port the Embedthis
            Appweb product to a new O/S or processor architecture.</p>

            <p>Embedthis Appweb has been written to maximize the ease of
            porting to a new environment. The O/S and processor dependent
            code has been contained to a few files while the bulk of the code
            is cross-platform. Most of this code is under the <b>mpr</b>
            sub-directory which represents the Embedthis Portable Run-time
            Executive.<br /></p>

            <p><span class="c3">NOTE:</span> When attempting a port, you
            should get the latest copy of the development source branch
            rather than using the download source package. You can get the
            latest development source by checking out a copy from the
            Subversion repository. Send email to <a href=
            "mailto:dev@mbedthis.com">dev@mbedthis.com</a> to request to be
            added to the Subversion authorization database. You will then be
            given checkout instructions.<br /></p>

            <p><span class="c3">NOTE:</span> Please read <a href=
            "building.html">Building from Source</a> before your read this
            document. It provide valuable background about the Appweb build
            system.<br /></p>

            <h2><a name="newOs" id="newOs"></a> <a href="#top"><img class=
            "nav" src="../../../images/upArrow.gif" height="16" width=
            "16" /></a> Porting to a new Operating System</h2>

            <p>Follow the following steps:</p>

            <ol>
              <li><span class="c3">Pick a Name for the Operating System
              Port</span><br />
              <br />
              If you are doing a port for a new operating system you need to
              pick a symbolic name that will be used in Makefiles, build
              scripts and for per operating system directories. Use all CAPS
              for your OS name without any "_" or "-" characters. For
              example: "LINUX" is the Appweb name for the Linux specific
              portions. For the rest of this document, we will use the name
              <b>NEWOS</b> for the O/S symbolic name.<br />
              <br /></li>

              <li><strong>Select the Required Appweb Features</strong><br />
              <br />
              Copy build/standard.defaults to build/myport.defaults and edit
              and modify the feature selection as required.<br />
              <br />
              You should turn BLD_FEATURE_MULTITHREAD off (use configure
              --disable-multi-thread) for your first porting effort as it
              will make debugging much easier. Disable all the features that
              your O/S does not support. See the <a href=
              "building.html">Building from Source</a> document for
              definitions of all the build variables used in these
              files.<br />
              <br /></li>

              <li><strong>Edit the configure script<br />
              <br /></strong> Edit ./configure and add your O/S to the
              setSystemConfiguration function. If your system is UNIX like,
              make sure you set eval ${unix}=1. You may also want to add code
              here to detect the O/S distribution.<br />
              <br /></li>

              <li><span class="c3">Create build/make/make.os.NEWOS<br />
              <br /></span> This step is probably one of the longest. You
              need to create a build/make/make.os.NEWOS file and change all
              the compiler and linker flag values for your operating system.
              Copy a version from an O/S that is closest to your target O/S.
              See the <a href="building.html">Building from Source</a>
              document for definitions of all the make variables used in this
              file.<br />
              <br /></li>

              <li><span class="c3">Create build/os/config.NEWOS<br />
              <br /></span> You also need to create a build/os/config.NEWOS
              file. This file describes the various tool names and file
              extensions used by your O/S. There are two conditional
              sections, one used for definitions for the host (target) system
              and ones for the build system.<br />
              <br /></li>

              <li>
                <strong>Run configure for the new target operating
                system.<br />
                <br /></strong> Run the configure program and specify the
                --host and --build switches. These switches take arguments of
                the form: CPU-VENDOR-OS. The tools/config.sub script
                validates these arguments. Most probably, your O/S and CPU
                architecture are already in this file. Review the file to see
                what is the best way to refer to your required O/S and CPU
                architecture. If you can't find your choices, you may need to
                modify this script to add a new operating system or
                CPU.<br />
                <br />
                When ready, run configure to generate the buildConfig.make,
                buildConfig.sh and buildConfig.h master build files. For
                example:<br />
                <pre>
./configure --defaults myport --host powerpc-wrs-vxworks --build i586-pc-cygwin --disable-multi-thread
</pre><br />
              </li>

              <li>
                <span class="c3">Select the Base O/S to Copy</span><br />
                <br />
                The easiest way to port to a new O/S is to find the closest
                existing supported O/S that the Appweb software already
                supports and use it as a base to modify. For example if you
                are porting to QNX, you may want to use the LINUX port as a
                base. You will need to copy some base O/S directories and
                configuration files to become the starting point for your new
                port. The directories to copy are (assuming we are copying
                the LINUX port)<br />
                <pre>
cp -R mpr/UNIX mpr/NEWOS<br />
</pre>

                <p>At this stage, don't copy all the per O/S package
                directories and files. These are used to create installable
                packages (E.g. RPM packages). If your system is UNIX-like,
                then you will use the mpr/UNIX/*.cpp files.<br />
                <br /></p>
              </li>

              <li><span class="c3">Tailor the cross-platform O/S
              header.</span><br />
              <br />
              To insulate most of the Appweb source code from the differences
              of various operating systems, the <b>mprOs.h</b> header file
              wraps all the required O/S headers and publishes a consistent
              set of types and prototypes. None of the source files include
              normal O/S headers like &lt;string.h&gt;. While this does slow
              builds down by including more headers than are required -- on
              modern CPUs it is barely noticeable.<br />
              <br />
              When porting mprOs.h, start by copying the sections in mprOs.h
              that pertain to your base copied O/S. These will be protected
              by "#if BASE_OS" defines. In the example of NEWOS, we would
              look for and copy any sections with "#if LINUX" and create "#if
              NEWOS" sections.<br />
              <br />
              DO NOT introduce conditional code in other O/S sections. It is
              better to copy the entire contents from the base O/S and
              modify. Replication here benefits greatly later on by isolating
              subtle changes from one O/S to another.<br />
              <br /></li>

              <li>
                <span class="c3">Tailor the Primary MPR header</span>

                <p>Next we edit the <span class="c3">mpr.h</span> header.
                Some operating system differences escape from mprOs.h and
                must be dealt with here. Search for sections that pertain to
                the base O/S and modify. It is acceptable and indeed
                preferable to modify sections rather than replicate. For
                example</p>

                <p>#if LINUX || QNX</p>

                <p>is better and clearer than duplicate code.<br />
                <br /></p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <span class="c3">Test the Headers with a Hello World
                Program.</span>

                <p>Don't use the make system yet. Just create an empty C++
                hello world program and include "mpr.h". Compile it and shake
                out the issues. You will need to define "-DNEWOS" on your
                compiler command line.<br />
                <br /></p>
              </li>

              <li><span class="c3">Port the Per O/S MPR Source
              Code</span><br />
              <br />
              Now is the time for the real work. Most of the operating system
              dependent code is confined to three source files: thread.cpp,
              mprOs.cpp and daemon.cpp. Thread.cpp contains the
              multiprocessing thread, lock and condition variable code. If
              you only intend to support single-threading, you can largely
              skip these code sections. Copy these three files from your base
              O/S into the <b>mpr/NEWOS</b> directory and modify as
              required.<br />
              <br /></li>

              <li>
                <span class="c3">Test the Make Subsystem</span><br />
                <br />
                To aid the porting to many operating systems, a simple build
                system is provided that is somewhat compatible with GNU
                configuration standards. While the GNU Autoconf/Libtool
                system could arguably do the job, it struggles in non-Unix
                environments. The Appweb build and make system makes fewer
                demands on the underlying operating system and is simpler in
                scope.

                <p>The make subsystem requires GNU make and a fairly
                compliant bash shell implementation. If you are using
                windows, the CYGWIN package will provide the GNU environment.
                If you are porting to an O/S that uses the GNU development
                tools, you probably have little to do in this step. If not,
                you may have more modifications required to your build/make/*
                and build/os/* files.<br />
                <br /></p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <span class="c3">Test Compile the Mpr</span>

                <p>To start out, test compile one file in MPR first. Let's
                pick an easy one: <b>buf.cpp.</b> The Appweb build system
                compiles objects for most directories into a common objects
                directory (./obj on Linux and on Windows: ./obj/Debug or
                ./obj/Release). This is done to make it easier to aggregate
                objects from various modules into common libraries. So to
                compile a single object, you need to specify the target
                object which will usually not be in the current
                directory.<br />
                <b><br /></b> cd mpr<br />
                make ../obj/buf.o</p>

                <p>At this stage of the porting effort, this will undoubtedly
                provoke a stream of errors. Use this to work out the bugs in
                mprOs.h, mpr.h and make.rules for your O/S.<br />
                <br /></p>
              </li>

              <li><span class="c3">Compile the Rest of the MPR<br />
              <br /></span> Once you have buf.cpp compiling, try the rest of
              the MPR.<br />
              <br />
              make<br />
              <br /></li>

              <li>
                <span class="c3">Test your Port of thread.cpp and
                mprOs.cpp</span>

                <p>The mpr, ejs, http and appweb directories all have
                extensive unit test suites to help you shake out the
                bugs.<br />
                Run:</p>

                <p>cd mpr/test<br />
                make test<br />
                <br /></p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <span class="c3">Compile and Test ejs -- the Embedded
                JavaScript Interpreter</span><br class="c4" />
                <br />
                This code should compile and build easily. It is quite
                cross-platform

                <p>cd ejs<br />
                make clean depend compile test<br />
                <br /></p>
              </li>

                <span class="c3">Compile the HTTP Web Server and
                Modules</span><br />
                <br />
                We should be accelerating by now. Again, this module is
                mostly cross-platform. Try:

                <p>cd http<br />
                make clean depend compile<br />
                <br /></p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <span class="c3">Test HTTP</span>

                <p>cd test<br />
                make test<br />
                <br /></p>
              </li>

              <li><span class="c3">Port Appweb</span><br />
              <br />
              The appweb directory only contains the main programs. All other
              functionality it provided by mpr, ejs and http. You may have
              some modifications in the main programs to setup your run-time
              environment correctly. Issues like multithreading or
              single-threading are controlled here.</li>

            have a basic port running, you should send it back for the team
            to look over and provide advice and suggestions. At the first
            opportunity, your changes may be merged back into the development
            tree so others can benefit from your work.<br />
            <br />

            <p>Good luck and all the best. Please give feedback to the
            development team at <a href=
