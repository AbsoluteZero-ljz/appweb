            <h1>Compatibility</h1>
            <p>Appweb APIs may evolve, and are thus subject to change between minor releases. The Appweb documentation provides a <a href="stability.html">Stability Classification</a> for each API group that reflects their stability with respect to forward changes.</p>

            <h2>Migrating to Appweb 8</h2>
            <p>Appweb 4 to 8 are highly compatible. Code written for Appweb 4 should migrate to Appweb 8 with few
            changes required. Appweb 4 introduced new build tools, and a garbage collector for memory allocation, so if you are migrating from Appweb 2 or 3, you will have to perform more significant changes to your application, handlers or filters. </p>

            <h2>Standards</h2>
            <p>Appweb supports the following standards:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">HTTP/1.1</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/CGI/">CGI 1.1</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt">Form-based File Upload in HTML</a></li>
            </ul>
