### SSL Certificates

Some samples require SSL certificates and keys. These can be generated in the Appweb source tree via:

    me generate-certs

Then in the samples directory, run

    me samples-certs

This will copy the generated certificates into the 'certs' directory.

### Building

To build the samples, see the per-sample README instructions. Many can run without extra build steps.

To build all, use:

    me --file samples.me samples
