#
#   Define authentication type, realm and URLs for the UI. The fields are:
#   The login form redirects to https and once logged in, redirects back to http.
#   Using https:/// will use the HTTPS protocol with the current IP:PORT.
#
#        type  realm        login-page                 login-service  logout-service  logged-in-page        logged-off-page
#
AuthType form  example.com  https:///public/login.html https:///login https:///logout https:///index.html   https:///public/login.html

#
#   Create a secure route for scripts, stylesheets and images to bypass authentication.
#   Needed for /login.html. If accessed via /public, then no auth.
#
<Route /public>
    Prefix /public
    Documents public
    AuthType none
</Route>

#

<Route /recipies>
    Prefix /recipies
    Documents recipies
    AuthType none
    Require ability cook
</Route>
